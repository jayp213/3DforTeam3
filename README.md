# Blender to Unity Tips
To make it easier to manage 3D Objects in Unity. After Importing A Blender File:
1) Right click on the Collection Asset in Hierarchy Window (The name of the .Blend file)
2) Select Unpack Prefab Completely
This is equivalent to unpacking the Prefab, and keeping on unpacking any Prefab instances that appear as a result because they were nested Prefabs or base Prefabs.
