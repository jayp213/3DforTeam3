# 3DforTeam3

# This repository will mainly consist of these filetypes (All work with Team's version of Unity)
.blend
.obj
.fbx

# INSTRUCTIONS FOR IMPORTING TO UNITY:
1) In Unity: IMPORT -> IMPORT NEW ASSET
2) Select MESH (Remember it should be any of the file type listed above)
3) Once you see the name of the Mesh (same as fileName) in the Project section, drag and drop the Mesh to Hierarchy Window
4) Ensure the Mesh is in center by looking at the Inspector Window in the Transform section

# NOTES:
* Always make sure the 3D Mesh File Type will stay in the Project's Assets Folder
* Materalize Mesh in Unity, not in Blender or any other 3D Software (Makes it easier for programmers for rendering)
* If Importing from Blender, make sure -> (Lights and Camera) are removed before saving
